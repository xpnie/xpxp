The task is to control the linear movement of an aerospace robotic arm between a 'Home' position and a 'Work' position.

**Inputs:**
- `MoveToWorkCmd` (BOOL): A momentary push button command to start moving towards the Work position.
- `MoveToHomeCmd` (BOOL): A momentary push button command to start moving towards the Home position.
- `AtWorkSensor` (BOOL): A sensor that is TRUE only when the arm is at the Work position.
- `AtHomeSensor` (BOOL): A sensor that is TRUE only when the arm is at the Home position.
- `MovementPermitted` (BOOL): A global safety signal. The arm is only allowed to move if this signal is TRUE.

**Outputs:**
- `MotorForward` (BOOL): Energizes the motor to move the arm towards the Work position.
- `MotorReverse` (BOOL): Energizes the motor to move the arm towards the Home position.

**Logic Requirements:**
1.  Pressing `MoveToWorkCmd` should start the `MotorForward` output. The motor should remain on until the `AtWorkSensor` becomes TRUE.
2.  Pressing `MoveToHomeCmd` should start the `MotorReverse` output. The motor should remain on until the `AtHomeSensor` becomes TRUE.
3.  The motors should stop immediately if `MovementPermitted` becomes FALSE at any time.
4.  `MotorForward` and `MotorReverse` must never be TRUE at the same time.
5.  A command to move in one direction should cancel any movement in the opposite direction.
